# Code Sprint Summary:
- loaded data into database
- discovered and got rid of inconsistencies in the data set
- created features using SQL queries
- testing a simple model based on the linear regression (scikit-learn)
- compared an accuracy of the created model with some other (simple) ones

# 23 XI 2015
- tried a different approach to the problem - use a logistic regression to identify a group of users that will buy any item between the end of week and the end of month first, then apply a linear regression only for the selected group (a prediction is terribly inaccurate because of many false positives in the initial phase)
- familiarized myself with the features selection techniques
- trying to make some statistical observations about the data
