<br />
Used libraries:<br />
- Matplotlib,<br />
- Seaborn,<br />
- Pylab,<br />
- Plotly.<br />
<br />
Workplan:<br />
1. How to use pandas.<br />
2. Simple plots, e.g. Number of new users per month.<br />
3. Plots which use more than one axis to count values (e.g. Number of purchased items grouped by category and country).<br />
4. Plots types and libraries - research.<br />
4. Titling and layer setting.<br />
5. Removing malformed data (solving problem with empty values).<br />
6. Generating plots and writing docs.<br />
7. Research on Bayesian Methods.<br /> 
<br />
Problems solved. How to:<br />
- drop malformed data,<br />
- generate plots on the whole set of data (virtual machine),<br />
- do scatter plots with bubbles,<br />
- use strings as ticks on labels,<br />
- improve layout so that everything is visible,<br />
- use Bayesian statistics (Poisson distribution, normal distribution, MLE, inverse gamma distribution).<br />
During my work occured many problems, however above are ones which demanded from me the biggest workload.<br />
