Used libraries:
- Matplotlib,
- Seaborn,
- Pylab,
- Plotly.

Workplan:
1. How to use pandas.
2. Simple plots, e.g. Number of new users per month.
3. Plots which use more than one axis to count values (e.g. Number of purchased items grouped by category and country).
4. Plots types and libraries - research.
4. Titling and layer setting.
5. Removing malformed data (solving problem with empty values).
6. Generating plots (for titles, please refer to source code or docs).
7. Research on Bayesian Methods. 

Problems solved. How to:
- drop malformed data,
- do scatter plots with bubbles,
- use strings as ticks on labels,
- improve layout so that everything is visible,
- use Bayesian statistics (Poisson distribution, normal distribution, MLE, inverse gamma distribution).
During my work occured many problems, however above are ones which demanded from me the biggest workload.
