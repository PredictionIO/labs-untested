7-8.11.2015:
- Imported data to SQL database
- First computations (number of registered users, all users, ...) (and data sets miss only ~10k users at all)
- A few views with (maybe) useful data based on datasets

18.11.2015:
- Updated database schema
- Collecting evidence for each user (to be used by estimation engine)

24.11.2015
- Updated database schema
- Exported sample data (group of ~150000 users - users who commited any transaction)
- Commited two simples linear regression tools on them (in model/)
- Comments written in model/README.md

01.12.2015
- Updated database schema
- Exported new samples
- Prepared normalized set (divide time intervals by 1M to decrease its weight)
- Results improved slightly
- Working with Decision Trees (surprisingly weak results here!)
- 3 new features (based on views)
- Worsen linear regression results (a bit)
- Improve Decision Trees regression results (noticeably)

02.12.2015
- Classification (first task) using Decision Trees Classifier with perfect(?) result. (It is so perfect, I have to verify it somehow).

12.12.2015
- Verified classification accuracy - not perfect, but stil better than expected (half of positive instances are false negative - not so bad being avare that positive instances are truly rare)

13.12.2015
- Updated database schema
- Created tool translating any given discrete feature to bit vector (utm_extract)
- Translated discrete feature (utmSource) into binary vector (as described by Marco). Disappointing results:
- Decision Trees regression var: ~~0.61 (dtr2.py comparing to dtr.py)
- Ridge regression var: ~~0.59 (ridge_reduced2.py comparing to ridge_reduced.py)

14.12.2015
- Tried Lasso and ElasticNet. Both give variance 0.59 regardles of used normalization parameters (although some normalization parameters really DO nice normalization of feature set). Maybe feature set is depleted. On the other hand full fledged solutions like Decision Trees offer better results anyway.

30.12.2015
- Updated database schema
- New features based on daily revenue in each day since register (not enough disk space to make computations required to generate similar features based on views)
- Tried Decision Trees regression and Elastic Net. DTR remains the same (0.62), Elastic Net improves slightly (0.60).

06.01.2016
- Updated database schema
- views per day (as above)
- No improvement...
