1. Database scheme - tables for data from *.csv files (without data)
2. A few views created on these data
3. Script to recreate all tables (important at lest for me to move database to more serious hardware)
4. Script to recreate all views - to be executed *after* data is imported.

3 and 4 are combined - views will be empty - recreate after data import is finished
