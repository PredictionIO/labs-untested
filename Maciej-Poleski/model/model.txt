data for 7 days -> expected revenue for 30 days

try to estimate expected revenue for 30 days assuming (data for 7 days)
linear regression on some random variables is one of possible approaches (hope not the only one...)

estimations
===========

Only for users who bought something


scratch below
=============

properties of a user:
revenue
bought items (with timestamp, quantity and price)
 - reduced to category (?)
ad for user registration
items viewed by user (with timestamp)

properties of group of users:
distribution of revenue (fixed time range?)
distribution of ads for registration
distribution of bought items (fixed time range?)
distribution of viewed items (fixed time range?)
